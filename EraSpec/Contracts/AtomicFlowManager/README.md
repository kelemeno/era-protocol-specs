# AtomicFlowManager

Source: `contracts/atomic-interop/AtomicFlowManager.sol` in the pinned era-contracts tree.

Review `Specs/` for state, operations, and assumptions; review `Properties/` for
the guarantees and their hypotheses. `Proofs/` contains the Lean-checked evidence
for those exact named propositions, plus auxiliary lemmas. Some spec modules
only import a shared specification when the topic needs no additional definitions.

Several `Model` and `RecoveryLimits` properties are one-state facts whose docstrings
used to make run-level claims; the docstrings now say so, and the run-level claims
are stated in the two `…Strong` topics:

- **ModelStrong.** Labelled runs (`LegRun`, equivalent to `Reach`). Every claim of a
  leg that starts below `Revertable` is preceded by an `authorize` of it in the same
  run; from `Committed` (resp. `Unset`) the only steps on a leg that ends claimable
  are `authorize` (resp. `append`, `authorize`); a run changes a leg exactly
  rank-gain times, so at most three. A reentrant model (`NestedRun`) with the order
  of `claimRefund`'s write as a parameter: under the deployed write-first order each
  leg pays out at most once however deep the callbacks nest; under the reversed
  order one `Revertable` leg pays out any number of times
  (`claim_order_decides_double_payout`).
- **RecoveryLimitsStrong.** Ties `RecoveryLimits` to the loop of
  `AssetRouterBase/Specs/AtomicRecovery.lean` and to the manager's state. Limit 1:
  a claim that the real loop accepts with fewer recoveries than calls, after which
  no run of the manager lets that leg be claimed again
  (`partial_stranding_is_terminal`). Limit 2: if some call reverts in every world
  satisfying an invariant that the bundle and the environment preserve, every retry
  reverts and the leg stays `Revertable` (`blocked_retry_reverts`,
  `blocked_leg_stays_revertable`). Without that invariant the retry can succeed
  (`retry_succeeds_once_blocker_clears`).

Model boundary for both topics: `MODEL-AFM-NESTED` in `../../../ASSUMPTIONS.md`
(no reentrant writes from `append`/`authorizeRefund`; the at-least-one-recovery
check is over-approximated; retry results need a caller-supplied invariant).

The full flow gate spans `AtomicInteropProof`, the commitment tree, and the
handler. Its multi-chain composition lives in `../../Protocol/`. Implementation
refinement and the known generator mismatch are recorded in
`../../Refinement.lean`; this folder does not certify the compiled contract.
