Read them in that order; each builds on the one before.

`SourceHeight` derives `Wf.capacity` instead of assuming it: a system built from
per-chain runs that carry `FullMerkle._height` (`systemOfRuns`, `RunsWf`) is `Wf`
(`WfOfRuns`), its heights are the source's (`RunsHeightsFromSource`), and every `Wf`
system with source heights is so built (`WfSourceHeightsFromRuns`).
`NoneOrAllOrBreakPinnedFromRuns` is the pinned partial-atomicity result over such
systems. `PaddedSystemFromRuns` / `MixedSystemFromRuns` show the countermodel systems'
heights are the ones the source computes. The batch-root tree's `capacity` field in
`Specs/Timeout.lean` is a different tree and is not covered.

- **Atomicity.** The gate requires an inclusion proof for every leg. If any leg of a
  flow executes, every leg is finalizable and no leg can be refunded on either
  timeout branch (`NoneOrAll`, `ExecutedExcludesAnyRefund`). The flow-id
  recomputation is meant to pin the leg list (`FlowIdCheckPinsLegList`, vacuous via
  `FlowHashInj`). Countermodels: a
  self-only gate admits a mixed outcome, a subset flow passes a gate without the
  id check, and without data availability a committed leg is stuck.
- **Timeout.** The "last batch that settled by the deadline" fact is derived from
  the three comparisons and the last-batch proof (`IsLastOnTimeDerived`,
  `TimeoutMeansMissedDeadline`), under the settlement layer's `Aggregates`
  invariant. `StaleRootRefundsDeliveredLeg` shows that invariant is load-bearing,
  so real-path claims inherit it.
- **Refund.** One outcome per obligation over every interleaving of every chain's
  manager calls (`ExecutedObligationNeverRefunded`). A cross-flow refund yields a
  collision of the flow-id hash on the two flows' own preimages
  (`CrossFlowIdClashIsPinnedCollision`).

The tree side is a fixed multi-chain, multi-batch history, and steps may cite
evidence from anywhere in it. That admits more refunds and executions than an
operational model, so excluding both is the stronger claim. An operational model
(or a projection theorem from one) is open. Also open: liveness (every committed
obligation eventually executes or refunds), and composing `CommitmentPinsLeg`
(once restated) with the manager's `no_double_append` and the tree's
`dedup_gate_sound` into a once-per-leg result. Source-side obligations are O7–O9 in
`../../Refinement.lean`.

These modules keep the namespaces they had on the `claude/proof-attempt-4f3778`
line (`Contracts.Atomicity`, `Contracts.Timeout`, `Contracts.Refund`).
